                 I had always carried Canon as she devour all the goodness around me, also someone who makes me feel good when I’m sad. When Ilook at her, it’s like looking into the highlights of my life, when in reality it’s much more than just happiness. Photography has taught me how beautiful the world and the people in it are. The urge to pull out my Canon, the instant I see something beautiful is spontaneous.Even if my memories start to fade overtime, the pictures I took hadcaptured the moments forever and looking at it just brings all the emotions back.
